Group project for Call Analysis

- A description of what has been implemented

    - In this project, a dataset consisting of calls to 311 are analyzed. For this project, we chose a   particular ZIP code (10025) for our analysis. We divided the project into 2 notebooks named 'Top 10' and 'Parking'.

        - Top10:
    
            In this notebook, we analyzed the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in our zip code. We found 'Noise - Residential' to be the top complaint type in our zip code.

        - Parking:

            In this notebook, we computed the total complaint type in our chosen ZIP code and for the whole dataset. We also computed how much of the complaint calls consist of illegal parking.
            We then analyzed the proportion of illegal parking from the total complaint type for the chosen zip code and for the whole dataset. 
            We found out that the proportion of illegal parking from the total complaint type is greater for the total dataset compared to our zipcode.
